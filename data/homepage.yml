  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '
    <p class="lead">
    I’m a very easy going, sociable, fast-learner, curious and natural leader. I do what I love, and I love what I do. I lead by example and work side by side with my teams.

    <p class="lead">
    At my work, I work primarily in Python, using FastAPI and the LangChain framework to develop features that take advantage of the cababilities of LLMs
    Beyond work, I am especially curious about blockchain applications and Zero-knowledge proofs.

    <p class="lead">
    My profile is a combination of technical and managerial experience, but always related to technological projects. I bring business and product vision to tech teams, partly thanks to having started an developed a company. I am a fast learner, curious to see how technology can improve the users experience in multiple areas. I have a strong motivation and sense of responsibility with myself, my team and clients (or peers), and people like my positive and easy going, can-do attitude.

    <p class="lead">
    On the technical side, I work mainly in Python, though I am working on expand my language skillset by working on some projects in Rust.
    In terms of learning interests, I am especially curious about blockchain applications and Zero-knowledge proofs.
