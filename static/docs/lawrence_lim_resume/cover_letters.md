## Alchemy

Dear Hiring Manager at Alchemy,

My name's Lawrence and I feel I strongly match what Alchemy is looking for in a candidate. I have used Alchemy's platform in the past to deploy smart contracts and the opportunity to contribute to a space I believe in is something I'm incredibly excited about.

What sets me a part from other candidates is how obsessed I am with constantly learning and applying my skills both in traditional SWE and blockchain related fields.

For example, I'm attending a graduate level class on cryptocurrencies where I'm studying the design choices of Ethereum and Bitcoin. I also started my own AI startup with a group of seven students, combining my passion for health and fitness with my software skills.

What I'm most into right now is my project with the Blockchain & Fintech club at NYU, where we're building a decentralized poker application, implementing the Mental Poker cryptographic protocol and building proofs to be verified on-chain.

Besides that, I'm a big Linux and Vim (Neovim) nerd and am a big proponent of open source, with merged contributions to LangChain (Python library). Besides that, I also have extensive leadership and agile experience, so I believe my communication and teamwork are a strong differentiating feature.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Warm Regards,
Lawrence
