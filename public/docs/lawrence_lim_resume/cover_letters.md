## Alchemy

Dear Hiring Manager at Alchemy,

My name's Lawrence and I feel I strongly match what Alchemy is looking for in a candidate. I have used Alchemy's platform in the past to deploy smart contracts and the opportunity to contribute to a space I believe in is something I'm incredibly excited about.

What sets me a part from other candidates is how obsessed I am with constantly learning and applying my skills both in traditional SWE and blockchain related fields.

For example, I'm attending a graduate level class on cryptocurrencies where I'm studying the design choices of Ethereum and Bitcoin. I also started my own AI startup with a group of seven students, combining my passion for health and fitness with my software skills.

What I'm most into right now is my project with the Blockchain & Fintech club at NYU, where we're building a decentralized poker application, implementing the Mental Poker cryptographic protocol and building proofs to be verified on-chain.

Besides that, I'm a big Linux and Vim (Neovim) nerd and am a big proponent of open source, with merged contributions to LangChain (Python library). Besides that, I also have extensive leadership and agile experience, so I believe my communication and teamwork are a strong differentiating feature.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Warm Regards,
Lawrence

## Ebay

This role with eBay gives me the very unique opportunity for me to apply my unique skillset of strong business sense with my technical expertise.

Things started to make sense when I learned about Agile Methodologies and what the product owner does in Scrum. My product sense was developed interesting through my experience serving as President of a business club at my uni taught me to think from a customer's perspective, who in my case, were the students that attended my events and programs.

This sense was combined with my technical expertise when I founded my startup HealthFirst AI with seven of my school mates. I really felt like the CEO role for me (with software development responsibilities) was exactly what I was meant to do because I was exercising all the skills I had developed up until that point.

This is why I am extremely excited about this opportunity from eBay.
